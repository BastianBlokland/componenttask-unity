# Api Reference


Main api lives in the '[ComponentTask](ComponentTask.html)' namespace. And some extension methods
live in the [UnityEngine](UnityEngine.html) namespace.

Reason for having those extension methods live in the UnityEngine namespace is that it avoids users
having to add `using` directives and also makes the api more discoverable as it will show up in
intellisense. To avoid cluttering the UnityEngine namespace as few as possibles types live there.

### Namespaces
* [ComponentTask](ComponentTask.html)
* [UnityEngine](UnityEngine.html)
